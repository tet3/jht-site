  title: All About Jared
  text: >+
    Jared Taylor is a small little big ole honkin' rat man who lives in the sewers (and also in Philadelphia, PA). He is like those 5’8” little mousy boys that Lizzo likes from the one TikTok, except he is too big to live in the walls, and cheese does not sit right with him. But he is 5’8”, so he’s got that going for him. When he is not playing dead to hide from strangers, digging through the trash, or eating food he finds on the ground, he is acting and making songs! So far, he has released one single, **Catalyst & Chaos**, and one EP, **A Lighter Heart EP**. He also makes small stuff and puts it on his [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jaredhtaylor), if you’re interested in that funky business.
    

    A little more about Jared: he’s a 19 year-old queer singer-songwriter. When he was younger, he wanted to be a lawyer to make lots of money, but he was afraid of public speaking. Now, he attends Temple University to be an actor, so looks like he’s 0 for 2 on that one. His music? Glad you asked. His influences range far and wide, from folk pop to folk rock, including but limited to LMFAO, Justin Bieber, Gabbie Hanna, and that one absolute banger of a Yo Gabba Gabba album. And also like 80s pop, alt rock, 70s pop, a little classical, country, you name it. People have described his music as “terrifying, like piss-your-pants-level scary”, “garbage”, and “Jared I’m trying to watch a British crime show please stop playing your songs on the soundbar”, but maybe he should stop asking his dad to describe his music. He started acting in middle school, which is also when he started writing his own music. He’s always been a poetry-first kinda guy, and his songs, though often simple in melodic construction, try to pack a punch in their lyrical content. Except for the one about a worm. That’s about a worm.
