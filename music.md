      text: >-
        Jared’s debut EP. The three songs on it are on the uplifting side: a jubilant celebration of personal freedom, a bittersweet reflection on childhood, an ode to friendship. Amidst a world that was falling apart, Jared’s intention was to bring levity into the lives of those who hear it. Available from [many digital music services](https://linktr.ee/jaredhtaylor).

        Jared’s debut single. It is a song about self loathing, about perpetuating a cycle of damage through your own actions. Happy, I know. Available from many digital music services, including [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/082EwEW3t8vjErHwVsuQeW?si=z49vK2fgQf6MtKq8wcrgzA).
